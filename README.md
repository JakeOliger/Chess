## Chess

An age-old game, re-imagined using an age-new framework. This is my second project in React.js -- the first following [my implementation of the tutorial](https://github.com/JakeOliger/TicTacToe-React). The primary aim of this project is for me to become more familiar with the React framework while doing something a little more fun than Tic-Tac-Toe.

### Todo

The following features are yet to be implemented.
* Castling
* En passant pawn capturing
* Prevent player from allowing King to be sacrificed
* Improve piece selection and movement UI
* Click outside the game cancels turn
* Detect end of game
* Better display for captured pieces
* Animate between piece moves (maybe?)
* Multiplayer (maybe??)
