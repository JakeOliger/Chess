## Chess

An age-old game, re-imagined using an age-new framework. This is my second project in React.js -- the first following [my implementation of the tutorial](https://github.com/JakeOliger/TicTacToe-React). The primary aim of this project is for me to become more familiar with the React framework while doing something a little more fun than Tic-Tac-Toe.
